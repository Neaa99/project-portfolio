# portfolio

This week I made a portfolio after a specific design. The site has focus on accessibility.
## The problem

This project has so much fun to do! It was nice to have a figma disegn to go after and practice "copying" designs for future employment.
I had a bit of trouble with my header were my profile pic didn't want to position correctly in the diffrent devices. But after help from my team I managed to get it to work!
